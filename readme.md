# JMR's Game of Life with Genetics

JMR's Game of Life is a unique twist on Conway's Game of Life with the addition of genetic mutations and more flexible rules. Each cell possesses genes that dictate its behavior and how it interacts with neighboring cells. These genes can mutate, leading to diverse behaviors in the simulation.

## Overview

The following are the genes available in each cell:

1. **Overcrowding Tolerance (OT):** Maximum number of neighbors a cell can have before it dies due to overcrowding.
2. **Isolation Tolerance (IT):** Minimum number of neighbors a cell needs to survive.
3. **Birth Threshold (BT):** Number of neighbors an empty cell needs to produce a new cell.
4. **Mutation Rate (MR):** Chance of a cell's genes mutating when it is reproduced.

The value of each gene is reflected in the cell's color.

## Features

- Germline mutation (at creation)
- Somatic mutations (each cycle)
- User-friendly interface
- Configurable mutation rates, allele ranges, and cell behavior
- Real-time statistics of different cell types
- Interactive cell placement and removal

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

Make sure to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

Just run the script using:

```bash
python JMRsGameOfLifewith4Genes.py
```

- Click to place or remove cells.
- Hover over cells to see information about their genes.
- Press SPACE to start and stop the simulation.
- Press 'q' to end the simulation.

You will also be prompted to enter specific parameters related to genetic mutations at the start.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by Conway's Game of Life, this project adds a new twist by introducing genetic mechanisms to create a more dynamic and biologically-inspired simulation.
